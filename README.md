# Analytics Mechanics Association (AMA) DEVELOP @ NASA JPL Pre-session GIS Training

### Greetings and welcome to my educational repository!

Included are my workshop code pieces and notes from the links listed below. I am completing these in preparation for the NASA DEVELOP SP25 session. I will be acting as the Project Lead for the *San Bernardino Wildland Fires Project* starting January 27, 2025. This project will be complete April 3, 2025. Please keep an eye out on my [website](https://saingersoll.github.io/posts.html) for any updates regarding talks about the project or other goodies.
